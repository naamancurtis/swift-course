//        if destination != nil {
//            print("Driving to \(destination!)") // The "!" forces swift to allow this variable through, even if it can't detect it's been set
//        } // Using "!" (force unwrapping) is generally considered lazy programming, Optional Binding is a better way of mitigating the risk that variables aren't assigned
        
        // Optional Binding - Swiftier way of doing things
        // Only when destination has a value a new constant will be created (userSetDestination) which will in turn be used to execute the code

            print("Driving to \(userSetDestination)") // No Force unwrap required
